Mid-sized businesses play an important role in the economy, whether focussed on machinery, chemicals, construction or electrical equipment. They may be in family ownership, and are known for their long-term continuity, investment into the workforce, and close involvement with local communities.

We help businesses with turnover of around £25m-£500m per year, or around 250 employees, set out a more digital vision appropriate to their size and ambitions, and put actions in place to support their long-term success.

Things we typically help mid-sized businesses with.
