    title: The public sector is under more pressure than ever
    content: >
      Citizens' expectations are constantly raised by the modern digital
      services they use every day. The civil service has a strong modernisation
      and reform agenda.


      We help public sector organisations run like a modern and well-equipped
      digital business, with a strong focus on their users.


      Most importantly, digital can enable fundamentally better ways of
      addressing the social challenges our institutions are tasked to address.

      Creating modern and efficient public institutions with users at their
      heart
    subtitle: >-
      something changed during the pandemic, and that the need to accelerate
      digital and data-enabled transformation of public services was more
      universally accepted than ever. Interestingly, the strong Social Value
      theme also accepted that we need to Do Digital Differently post-pandemic,
      which means addressing a range of issues about how we use data, how we
      behave collectively yet delivery locally, and how we ensure a systemic
      approach to digitally-enabled public services that leaves no-one behind.
      We can support your change journey, building on our deep public sector
      digital and transformation expertise.

          what is different about governing in an era filled with pervasive
          digital technologies


          Digital transformation means designing services based on user needs,
          making it easier for the citizen to do what they need to do, and
          reducing the cost for government to provide those services.

          focusing not on show-off technology and futuristic promises, but on
          the solid building blocks of a modern public sector organisation which
          uses digital technology as a means to better serve the public and meet
          its mission, not as an end in itself.

          "A lot of governments still think about technology as something they
          can graft onto their existing ways of working to make things run a
          little bit faster and / or cheaper. What many fail to grasp is that
          real digital transformation runs much deeper: not just seeking to
          improve industrial-era bureaucracies at the margins but rather to
          re-imagine them altogether for the internet era."


          "This is where the comparison between running a country and running a
          company is most instructive. A company put in charge of the business
          of government would view the citizen as the customer — and
          consequently build government services around them based on a
          sophisticated understanding of user needs."


          "delivering on user needs isn’t about changing websites but rather
          about changing government itself.After all, an obsolete operating
          model made incrementally better is still an obsolete operating model
          (if you don’t believe me, ask Blockbuster)."


          "There is huge potential to improve public services by fusing digital
          technologies with a laser focus on user needs. There are also some
          important considerations that weigh more heavily on the state than on
          private companies."


          "Unlike companies, governments can’t choose their customers or opt out
          of serving difficult demographics.


          "For too long now, governments’ monopolies on public service delivery
          have insulated them from the internet revolution.


          "At first, as the gap between our experiences as citizens and as
          internet-era consumers started to widen, it was easy to shrug it off.
          Being on the cutting edge of innovation is exciting but also risky and
          expensive, and not where we expect most public services to be.


          "Now that great digital experiences are commonplace in our lives,
          however, a yawning chasm between the user experience in public
          services and everything else may be a bigger risk that many political
          leaders realise — particularly if repeated disappointment causes some
          people seriously to question the point of speaking up, showing up to
          vote or paying the tax they owe."
