    title: The public sector is under more pressure than ever
    content: >
      Citizens' expectations are constantly raised by the modern digital
      services they use every day. The civil service has a strong modernisation
      and reform agenda.


      We help public sector organisations run like a modern and well-equipped
      digital business, with a strong focus on their users.


      Most importantly, digital can enable fundamentally better ways of
      addressing the social challenges our institutions are tasked to address.

          what is different about governing in an era filled with pervasive
          digital technologies


          Digital transformation means designing services based on user needs,
          making it easier for the citizen to do what they need to do, and
          reducing the cost for government to provide those services.

          iterative strategy, focusing on real outcomes for residents, 
          businesses,  visitors and  staff.


          focusing not on show-off technology and futuristic promises, but on
          the solid building blocks of a modern public sector organisation which
          uses digital technology as a means to better serve the public and meet
          its mission, not as an end in itself.

          not acting as though a change programme is a way of migrating from one
          stable state to another stable state, which is an illusion
