          what is different about governing in an era filled with pervasive
          digital technologies


          Digital transformation means designing services based on user needs,
          making it easier for the citizen to do what they need to do, and
          reducing the cost for government to provide those services.

          businesses,  visitors and  staff.


          focusing not on show-off technology and futuristic promises, but on
          the solid building blocks of a modern public sector organisation which
          uses digital technology as a means to better serve the public and meet
          its mission, not as an end in itself.
