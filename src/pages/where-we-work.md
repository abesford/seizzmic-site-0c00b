          Mid-cap companies play an important role in the economy, may be
          focussed on machinery, chemicals, construction or electrical
          equipment.




          may be in family ownership, long-term continuity, investment into the
          workforce, and close involvement with local social and cultural
          institution


          successful mid-cap companies suggests that British firms are far more
          short-term orientated in terms of management and policy raising the
          question whether the UK Mittelstand can endure over time in the same
          manner as the German equivalent, something the British government

          Globalisation opens up new and exciting opportunities for businesses,
          but for many it can be more of a death sentence. Larger multinationals
          may sometimes thrive, but many smaller players become victims of
          increasing global consolidation. One winning strategy, particularly
          appropriate for smaller businesses is to pursue a global niche
          strategy.


          We help businesses with turnover of around £25m-£500m per year, or
          around 250 employees
