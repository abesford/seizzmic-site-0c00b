          Across all industries, enterprises need to be more competitive and
          high-performing than ever before. Just becoming a better, more digital
          version of what you have been in the past isn’t enough.


          We help enterprises rethink their vision and business models and take
          courageous steps - to win in the digital economy and get ready for
          what's next.

          Mid-sized businesses play an important role in the economy, whether
          focussed on machinery, chemicals, construction or electrical
          equipment. They may be in family ownership, and are known for their
          long-term continuity, investment into the workforce, and close
          involvement with local communities.


          Globalisation opens up new and exciting opportunities for mid-cap
          businesses. But many smaller players become victims of increasing
          global consolidation by larger multinationals.


          We help businesses with turnover of around £25m-£500m per year, or
          around 250 employees, set out a more digital vision appropriate to
          their size and ambitions, and put actions in place to support their
          long-term success.
