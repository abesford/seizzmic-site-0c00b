**The internet used to be a niche interest for academics and enthusiasts. Now it is part of almost everyone's day-to-day life.**

When the world wide web was created in 1989, only 0.5% of the world's population were online. During the early 2000s people got online with a PC, and maybe there are now about 1bn PCs globally. But over 4bn people have a smartphone, and there are only 5.7bn adults on earth.

This created a period in the 2010s where "Software ate the world", bringing winners (Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, PayPal) and losers (Blockbuster, Borders, Kodak). Since then, communication and commerce via the internet have become a central focus for businesses, consumers, government, and the media. The computer and communications industries have been converging, and smartphones are basically 'done'.

Behind the scenes the supporting infrastructure has evolved to change the way we consume computing resources, paying only for what you use rather than having to invest in data centres and servers. We benefit from massive economies of scale, and can be more flexible than ever, adding computing resources with just a click. Cloud computing lets us focus on customers and stop spending money and attention running infrastructure.

Together these rapidly accelerating technologies radically change what individuals and organisations can do. And the force of all these developments is changing societies and our political economy.

Even pre-pandemic, \*\*\*customer expectations\*\*\* - many employees expected to be able to work anywhere and from any device. Now, remote work has become completely mainstream which means teams can be located anywhere and hire from anywhere.

massive, forced global experiment with remote working and services

Technology based services have improved significantly this year, rising to the moment when consumers needed them, and they will continue to improve relative to legacy offerings. And consumers have installed the apps, left their cards on file, and adopted different routines. The genie is out of the bottle. It is not going back in.

These changes are not temporary. But the pace was forced by the response to the pandemic and may slow down depending on leadership.

Many of us can't imagine what life would be like now without the services that run over the internet. It completely changed the way we could cope with the events of 2020-21. But the internet's history has just begun. it is still young and rapidly changing. Recent events have highlighted how tech companies have become involved in political speech in ways they were never equipped to deal with. Early internet culture / free software etc. World in which all ideas came from within 50 miles of Silicon Valley is now over, importance of China.
