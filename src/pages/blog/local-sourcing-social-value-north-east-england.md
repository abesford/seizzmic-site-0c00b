We are based in North East England and operate anywhere.

makes geography matter much less. And we have remote work becoming mainstream which means startups can be located anywhere and hire from anywhere.

public procurement policy - social value

big procurers can use their influence locally

give back to area / contribute to local tech ecosystem

develop local skills - keep global perspective and skills

when we look back at 2020 in a few years, we will see that it was the year that everything changed for tech/startups/VC/crypto and set the stage for a decade of transformational change
