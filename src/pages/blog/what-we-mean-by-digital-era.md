**The internet used to be a niche interest for academics and enthusiasts. Now it is part of almost everyone's day-to-day life.**

When the world wide web was created in 1989, only 0.5% of the world's population were online. During the early 2000s people got online with a PC, and maybe there are now about 1bn PCs globally. But over 4bn people have a smartphone, and there are only 5.7bn adults on earth.

The rapid development of the internet created a period in the 2010s where "Software ate the world", with businesses in all industries being disrupted, bringing winners (Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, PayPal) and losers (Blockbuster, Borders, Kodak). Communication and commerce via the internet have become a central focus for businesses, consumers, government, and the media. The computer and communications industries have been converging, and smartphones are basically 'done'.

Behind the scenes, the supporting infrastructure has evolved to change the way we consume computing resources, paying only for what you use rather than having to invest in data centres and servers. We benefit from massive economies of scale, and can be more flexible than ever, adding computing resources with just a click.

> Cloud computing lets us focus on customers and stop spending money and attention running infrastructure.

We are generating more data than ever about everything we do online, and becoming increasingly aware of how it can be used - both for good (to personalise services to us) and for things we are less comfortable with. Hacking incidents can make headline news, and cyber-security has finally become a boardroom issue.

Together these accelerating technologies have enabled completely new business models, which radically change what individuals and organisations can do. And the force of all these developments is changing societies and our political economy.

Even pre-pandemic, the expectations of customers and citizens were being set by the best of the online services which they used on a day-to-day basis. Many employees already wanted to be able to work anywhere and from any device. Now, following the massive, forced global experiment during the pandemic, remote work has become completely mainstream. We now have more confidence that teams can be located anywhere, and that we could hire from anywhere.

Technology-based services also improved significantly during the Covid crisis, rising to the needs of their users. They will continue to improve relative to the previous offerings. Consumers have now tried buying different categories of products online, installed the apps, saved their credit cards, and adopted different routines. Patients had remote consultations with their GPs. We have broken habits like flying to business meetings. These changes are not temporary.

Forced by the pandemic, we have shown the incredible pace of change that can be achieved. Whether we can sustain that pace in future will depend on the leadership of our organisations.

Many of us can't now imagine what life would be like without the services that run over the internet. But the history of the digital era has just begun. It is still comparatively young and is changing rapidly.

Recent world events highlight how tech companies have become involved in new areas, like political speech, they were never equipped to deal with. We are necessarily now moving into a period of regulation, which will be at odds with the early culture of the internet - that information should be free to distribute and share, or that users can remain anonymous. The time when all tech ideas came from within 50 miles of Silicon Valley is now over: China has more people online than the USA and Europe combined.
