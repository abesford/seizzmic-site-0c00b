Any vision for digital change needs to include security at its heart, and not just include it as an afterthought. This can be a juggle because other themes must also run strongly through your plans, especially around people and technology.

have aspects in common, for example the need to handle sensitive personal data. But different areas naturally have different threat profiles. Your organisation could be targeted by organised criminals, hacktivists or state actors, who may use attacks based on social engineering or spear phishing.

### We help senior leaders understand cyber-security better

Transformation is a leadership problem and sits in the realm of the boardroom; it is made possible by leaders understanding what it means, and setting out a vision for the organisation. Those people generally don’t have a deep understanding of cybersecurity, but increasingly recognise how critical it is, because they have heard of WannaCry ransomware, Cambridge Analytica data mining, and British Airways/Marriott fines under GDPR.

There is a fine trade off between making a service useful and making it safe. We help senior leaders of organisations understand the risks and the choices they face, and clearly communicate the mitigations that can be put in place.

My view is that transformation leaders always have a role to play in security. This could be helping board members understand what good looks like, and helping them understand options and consequences. Equally it could be helping to raise colleagues’ awareness and understanding as part of a more general digital upskilling.

### We help you understand the human factors

It’s impossible to overstate the human factor. In government terms this applies to the people who use government services, as well as the people working within government agencies.

Digital services rely on balancing a low-friction user journey, with the need for proportionate controls to limit business risk. Designing this successfully can only be done by putting the users at the centre of the design. For public services this will touch on user identity, data ownership and sharing, minimising risk and administrative errors that could cause significant damage – all while respecting people’s privacy and rights.

Criminals might impersonate these services without the victim ever contacting the agency in question, so this is in part a national problem, not an organisational one. For example, the UK’s tax, payments and customs authority (HMRC) has experienced significant criminal use of their brand, highlighting the need for a national response to protect citizens and ensure that when people see an email from an email address at your organisation they can trust it.

Within government agencies, for those who advise on policy, build technology solutions, and deliver front-line operations, there are also threats at the human level.

### We help you create the right conditions in your organisation for delivering new services

Of course boards will always want to know “Are we secure, and compliant?” But when you are leading digital change, they probably also want to know “Why are we not more of a “digital business yet?”. So there has to be a security perspective on the organisation of the future. Frequently this means evolving the security focus so that it is not just about securing networks and endpoints, but extends to designing secure services.

This means enabling people and empowering teams. Someone in your organisation is eventually going to end up attempting to do secure service design themselves – with or without any guidance from specialists. Cybersecurity practitioners need to collaborate across the organisation, avoid creating factions, and make sure it gets done right and integrates with your other layers of defence.

### We help you embrace digital change and experiment

Any big organisation needs to be able to operate while under persistent threats and sophisticated attacks. And you need your teams to be enabled to experiment (safely), test and learn what works, and continuously evolve services to deal with the evolving landscape they operate in. Security leaders can and should be at the heart of safely delivering the transformation ambition.

One key factor when you are building new digital services in this environment is that you have to be careful with which parts need an iterative test-and-learn approach, and which parts need a high-volume, stable and auditable approach. Sometimes this experimentation is essential, for example when creating new online services which you hope will change people’s behaviours. Other times this can be risky or impossible, for example if you consider the interface to the banking system. Trying to be "Agile everywhere" is normally too simplistic.
