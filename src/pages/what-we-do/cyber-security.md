Any vision for digital change needs to include security at its heart, and not just include it as an afterthought. This can be a juggle because other themes must also run strongly through your plans, especially around people and technology.

We can help:

### Build cyber-security into your vision

Different organisations naturally handle different amounts of sensitive data and have different threat profiles.

But all digital services face a trade-off between being highly usable, and the need for controls that limit the risks faced by the organisation. To design this successfully it's vital to start with the needs of the users of the service. Done right, it can reduce the risks from fraud and administrative errors.

There are human factors that apply to the people who use your services, as well as the people working in your organisation. Your concerns could even extend to people you had no previous relationship with, for example if criminals impersonate your services without the victim ever contacting you.

Your future vision needs to have a clear position on areas like user identity, data ownership and sharing, and respect for people’s privacy and rights. Success of this vision depends on the right infrastructure, for example to ensure that when people see an email from an address at your organisation, they can trust it.

### Help senior leaders understand cyber-security better

Digital change is a leadership problem and sits in the realm of the boardroom; it is made possible by leaders understanding what it means, and setting out a vision for the organisation. Those people generally don’t have a deep understanding of cyber-security, but increasingly recognise how critical it is, because they have heard of WannaCry ransomware, Cambridge Analytica data mining, and British Airways/Marriott fines under GDPR.

There is a fine trade off between making things useful and making them safe. We help senior leaders of organisations understand the risks and the choices they face, and clearly communicate the mitigations that can be put in place.

We help digital change leaders play the right role in security. This could be helping board members understand what good looks like. Or it could be helping to raise colleagues’ awareness and understanding as part of a more general digital upskilling.

### Create the right conditions in your organisation for delivering new services

Of course boards will always want to know “Are we secure, and compliant?” But when you are leading digital change, they probably also want to know “Why are we not more of a “digital business yet?”. So there has to be a security perspective on the organisation of the future. Frequently this means evolving the security focus so that it is not just about securing networks and endpoints, but extends to designing secure services.

This means enabling people and empowering teams. Someone in your organisation is eventually going to end up attempting to do secure service design themselves – with or without any guidance from specialists. Cyber-security practitioners need to collaborate across the organisation, avoid creating factions, and make sure it gets done right and integrates with your other layers of defence.

### Embrace digital change and experiment safely

Any big organisation needs to be able to operate while under persistent threats and sophisticated attacks. And you need your teams to be enabled to experiment safely, test and learn what works, and continuously evolve services to deal with the evolving landscape they operate in. Security teams can and should be at the heart of safely delivering the transformation ambition.

One key factor when you are building new digital services in this environment is that you have to be careful with which parts need an iterative test-and-learn approach, and which parts need a high-volume, stable and auditable approach. Sometimes this experimentation is essential, for example when creating new online services which you hope will change people’s behaviours. Other times this can be risky or impossible, for example if you  interface to the banking system. Trying to be "Agile everywhere" is normally too simplistic.
