        content: "My exec team all got behind the strategy, which was stretching but within our reach.\_ We're much more digital now. It's helped us look after our customers during the pandemic, and we now feel well positioned for growth. I couldn't imagine going back."

          I've really been able to shift the perception of my CEO and the board.
          Technology had just been a cost to them before. Now we're enabling
          them to do things they never thought would be possible, and we're
          moving fast together to do what the business needs. I sleep better now
          we're more confident we're keeping the business safe from cyber
          threats.

          The big breakthrough was getting all the different teams pulling in
          the same direction towards our shared vision. It really feels
          different here now. My front-line colleagues love how they can spend
          more time on the real job of helping people.
