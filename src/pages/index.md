          Covid-19 accelerated trends that had been emerging for many years. The
          organisations to survive and thrive will be the ones that [adapt to
          the digital era](/blog/what-we-mean-by-internet-era/).


          Building a new digital business from scratch is easier than ever. And
          people outside of traditional institutions can stand up viable
          alternatives to the status quo.


          But if your organisation has been around for a while, you'll have
          built up an array of technologies and processes which can hold you
          back. We help you unravel this and become more digital [on the inside
          as well as the outside](/blog/digital-inside-and-outside).

          I've really been able to shift the perception of my CEO and the board.
          Technology had just been a cost to them before. Now we're enabling the
          business to do things they never thought would be possible, and we're
          moving fast together to do what's needed. I sleep better now we're
          more confident we're keeping the business safe from cyber threats.

          The big breakthrough was getting all the different teams pulling in
          the same direction towards our shared vision. It really feels
          different here now. My front-line colleagues love how they can spend
          more time on the real job of helping people.
