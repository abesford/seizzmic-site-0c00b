At **seizzmic** we're building a diverse group of people with a strong blend of skills. As a new company we've got a start-up mindset, as well as the credentials of operating internationally and at scale.

We don't follow the big consultancy model of an exhausting up-or-out career where what you need to do to progress might differ from what's best for your client. Instead we want to do the right thing, and achieve a sense of balance. The opportunity to work on high-impact projects as well as enjoy your life.

If you're interested in working together please get in touch <info@seizzmic.com> for an informal conversation.

#### You'll have

*   Experience delivering and helping to lead client engagements, working with senior client teams and developing strong, trusting relationships.

*   Credibility to develop new business.
    [Read more about what we do](/what-we-do).

#### We're looking for

*   Consultancy experience and a willingness to pitch in. We're still new and our credibility is paramount, so at this stage we need experienced people.

*   Someone who 'gets' and is passionate about digital transformation, data, organisational change, and/or digital government and public service delivery.

*   Experience of working with decision makers and delivery teams within a large, complex organisation. This might have been in a multinational corporation or the public sector.

*   People who have 'been there and done that', leading digital transformation, technology delivery or organisation change. Your background may be in digital delivery as a product owner, delivery manager, user researcher or service designer.

#### What's in it for you?

*   The chance to be entrepreneurial and shape the development of the business from an early stage
*   Flexible working and flexible hours, either on payroll or subcontracting as an associate
*   Home and remote working possible (obviously), with work on client sites as appropriate
*   Opportunity to build your expertise and profile
*   Space to focus on giving something back to develop the local tech community

# Partnerships

Serious change always relies on a range of complementary skills to get the job done. Sometimes our clients have these in place, and other times we may help bring in the right people.

Typically the kind of skills we work alongside include:

*   data specialists
*   technical architects
*   user researchers
*   digital delivery teams
*   automation specialists
*   illustrators
*   SMEs with innovative products
